# Overview

This is a journaling application called "MacJournal II" that mimics the classic Mac OS interface and experience. It's a full-stack web application built with React on the frontend and Express.js on the backend, designed to provide a nostalgic Mac-like desktop environment for writing and managing journal entries. The app features draggable windows, Mac-style UI components, authentic Mac sounds for interactions, rich text formatting with color highlighting, and search functionality.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with custom Mac-themed styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Mac OS color variables and styling
- **State Management**: React Query for server state management and local React state for UI
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Window Management**: Custom draggable window system that simulates Mac OS desktop experience

## Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Data Layer**: Dual storage approach with in-memory storage (MemStorage) and Drizzle ORM prepared for PostgreSQL
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints for journal entry CRUD operations
- **Development Server**: Hot reload with Vite integration in development mode
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes

## Data Storage Solutions
- **Current**: In-memory storage using Map data structure for development/demo purposes
- **Production Ready**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with Neon Database serverless driver
- **Schema**: Single journal entries table with UUID primary keys, title, content, tags array, and timestamps
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations

## Authentication and Authorization
- Currently not implemented - the application operates without user authentication
- Session handling infrastructure is present (connect-pg-simple) but not actively used

## External Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database (PostgreSQL-compatible serverless database)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components
- **Sound System**: Web Audio API for Mac-style interaction sounds
- **Development Tools**: 
  - Replit integration with cartographer plugin and runtime error overlay
  - ESBuild for production server bundling
  - PostCSS with Autoprefixer for CSS processing

## Key Design Decisions
- **Mac OS Aesthetic**: Complete visual and auditory recreation of classic Mac OS interface
- **Window Management**: Custom implementation of draggable, focusable windows with z-index management
- **Rich Text Formatting**: Toolbar-based approach with markdown-like syntax for storage and HTML rendering for display
- **Sound System**: Toggle-able authentic Mac keyboard typing and mouse click sounds using Web Audio API
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across journal entries, tags, and dates with proper highlight rendering
- **Modular Storage**: Interface-based storage system allowing easy switching between in-memory and database storage
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with shared schemas between frontend and backend
- **Component Architecture**: Separation of UI components, business logic, and data management
